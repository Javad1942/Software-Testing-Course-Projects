#  Software Testing Course Projects | Fall 2025 üçÇ

Welcome! This repository contains the official project assignments for the Software Testing course at Islamic Azad University.

## Introduction

This project-based curriculum was designed by me, **Javad Hashemi**, as the Teaching Assistant (TA) for this course, under the supervision of the esteemed course instructor, **Dr. Zagari**. Our goal is to move beyond theory and provide you with a series of hands-on, practical experiences that mirror the challenges and workflows of the modern software industry.

## üí° Learning Objectives: What Will You Master?

By successfully completing the four projects in this series, you will not just learn about software testing; you will become a practitioner. You will gain proficiency in a suite of modern tools and develop a robust, practical skillset, including:

-   **Foundational Testing Principles:** Mastering **Unit Testing** to ensure the reliability of individual code components.
-   **API & Service Validation:** Learning to perform **API Testing** to verify the integrity and functionality of web services‚Äîa crucial skill in today's interconnected world.
-   **UI Automation Expertise:** Gaining hands-on experience with **Selenium** to automate **User Interface (UI) Testing** and simulate real user interactions.
-   **Holistic Quality Assurance:** Combining all learned concepts to execute comprehensive **End-to-End (E2E) Tests** that validate an entire application workflow.
-   **Professional Version Control:** Becoming proficient in using **Git and GitHub**, including branching, committing, and collaborating through Pull Requests‚Äîthe industry standard for software development.
-   **Modern Development Workflows:** Experiencing a **CI/CD (Continuous Integration)** pipeline through **GitHub Actions**, where your tests are run automatically, providing you with instant feedback.

##  workflow-process Workflow: How to Submit Your Projects

To ensure a smooth and professional workflow, all projects must be submitted using the standard Fork & Pull Request model. Please follow these steps carefully for each project:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by creating your own personal copy of this repository. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.

2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Javad1942/Software-Testing-Course-Projects.git]
    ```

3.  **Create a New Branch:** Before starting each new project, create a dedicated branch for it. This keeps your work organized and separate from the main codebase.
    ```bash
    # Example for Project 1
    git checkout -b project-1-solution
    ```

4.  **Complete Your Work:** Do your work, commit your changes frequently with clear messages, and finally, push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Complete Project 1 tasks"
    git push origin project-1-solution
    ```

5.  **Create a Pull Request:** From your forked repository on GitHub, create a new Pull Request from your project branch to the `main` branch of **this original repository**. This will officially submit your work for review.

## ü§ñ Automated Feedback & Grading

To provide you with rapid feedback, your submissions will be evaluated by an intelligent, automated system. When you create a Pull Request, **GitHub Actions** will automatically run your tests to check for correctness and functionality. You can see the results of this check directly on your Pull Request page.

A successful automated check is the first step toward a successful submission. Final grading will be based on the quality of your tests, code cleanliness, and adherence to the project requirements.

Good luck, and let's build some high-quality, well-tested software!
